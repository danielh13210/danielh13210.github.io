            Hi, I am Daniel. I was born on August 2012. I have a strong interest in electronics and computers throughout
            my life.<br><br>
            When I was four, my parents gave me a toy to learn electronics, called Snap Circuits. Since
            then, I began to love electronics a lot. Soon, I had an electronics teacher who taught me about Boolean
            algebra and logic gates. He introduced me to Arduino which was the first time I learned to program. When I
            was six, I started learning Python from a book called Hello World.<br><br>
            A year later, I started learning Nand2Tetris. There were two teachers who helped me to finish this course.
            It took me about a year to finish it. This course helped me to understand how computers work from just one
            component called &quot;NAND&quot; up to an operating system. I also played <a href="https://nandgame.com" target="_blank">NandGame</a> which is based on Nand2Tetris.
            <br><br>
            I started programming every day since I could use Arduino. I have done many projects, including this
            portfolio.
            Since I am homeschooled, I study by myself through books and online learning platforms.
            Also, I did some hardware projects. The last project was my 8-bit computer, which I built by following a
            series of YouTube videos.
            Until now, I keep learning, but sometimes unable to study only by myself because some of the subjects are
            too hard to study without a mentor, or require facilities that are currently out of my reach. Therefore, I
            hope that I can be accepted at
            a university, where I would have a mentor and laboratory facilities.<br><br>
            With my current skillset, I am able to help my grandparents when they have problems with their smartphone or
            laptop software. I also can help my father with his computer software and connections. At the moment, I help my mentor with some software that he made at his makerspace place.<br><br>
            In the long run, I want to study chip &amp; motherboard design. I also want to make a smartphone, tablet, and laptop that will be more repairable, hence more sustainable.
